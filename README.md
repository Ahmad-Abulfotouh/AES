# AES
implementation to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) using C++

# Resources
The code is a rewrite of the missing code annotated in a playlist located in a channel called Creel https://www.youtube.com/c/WhatsACreel

# Development
1.```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahmad-Abulfotouh/AES/
```
if you are on linux/mac go to the file directory then type

Otherwise, you can download gcc or just use a c++ IDE to run it.
