# AES
implementation to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) using C++

# Resources
The code is a rewrite of the missing code annotated in a playlist located in a channel called Creel https://www.youtube.com/c/WhatsACreel

# Development
on the terminal, run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahmad-Abulfotouh/AES/
```
if you are on linux/mac go to the file directory then run

```bash
g++ aes.cpp
```
```bash
./a.out
```
Otherwise, you can download gcc in your computer, or just open it using a c++ IDE.
